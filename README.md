An Overview of Shells:
A shell is a fundamental and important part of your Linux computing
environment. Shells are user programs not unlike other text-based
programs and utilities. They offer a rich customizable interface to your
system. Some of the main items provided by your shell are:
• An interactive textual user interface to the operating system.
• An operating environment.
• A facility for launching and managing commands and programs.
• A programming language.
